Once we have discussed the examples, we create a Concordion specification describing the feature with examples.

# Specification Structure

Concordion provides you the flexibility to structure your specifications however you like.

As a guideline, specifications are often based on individual features of a system. Larger features are normally broken down into smaller features, creating small, focussed specifications that are faster to check.

A common structure is:

{% if md %}
    # Feature title

    Feature description

    ## Business Rules or Acceptance Criteria


    - Rule 1
    - Rule 2

    ...

    ## Additional detail

    Any other background info

    ### Example 1

    details of example 1

    ### Example 2

    details of example 2

    ...

{% elsif html %}

    <h1>Feature title</h1>

    Feature description

    <h2>Business Rules or Acceptance Criteria</h2>

    - Rule 1
    - Rule 2

    ...

    <h2>Additional detail</h2>

    Any other background info

    <h3>Example 1</h3>

    details of example 1

    <h3>Example 2</h3>

    details of example 2

    ...

{% endif %}

## Structure of Examples

Concordion provides the flexibility to structure examples however you like.

When documenting the _context_, _action_ and _outcome_ of an example, you can write these three parts using the Gherkin "Given, When, Then" language. This is often a good way to get started. Once you become familiar with thinking about the context, action and outcome, you may find ways to describe your example in a more natural language.

For example, you could use either:

    Given a user with full name John Smith
    When the system splits the name
    Then the first name is John and the last name is Smith

or:

    The full name John Smith will be broken into first name John and last name Smith

The [Hints and Tips]({{site.baseurl}}/technique/{{ page.fixture_language }}/{{ page.spec_type }}) page contains some good practices for writing specifications, including:

* Writing at a high level of abstraction
* Only reveal data the specification actually needs
* Create focussed examples

## Creating a suite

{{ spec_type_desc }} links allow us to create a structured suite of specifications, with the pages nested under a hierarchical index. For example:

    Product
         Theme
              Feature
                  Sub-Feature
                  Sub-Feature
              Feature
              Feature
                  Sub-Feature
         Theme
              Feature
                  Sub-Feature
              Feature

At each level, the specification contains links to all the specifications below it. For example, a theme page would describe the theme and link to all the features in the theme. The specifications can be nested arbitrarily deep.

By using this approach, and instrumenting the links to child specifications with the [run command]({{site.baseurl}}/instrumenting/{{ page.fixture_language }}/{{ page.spec_type }}#run-command), executing any specification will automatically execute all its child specifications, with the results aggregated upwards.

### Breadcrumbs

To make it easier to navigate around the results, and to remove the headache of having to maintain upward links manually, breadcrumbs are automatically added to output.

In order for breadcrumbs to be generated, certain conventions must be followed.

![Example of breadcrumbs]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/documenting-breadcrumbs.png)

Further details: [Breadcrumbs specification](https://concordion.github.io/concordion/latest/spec/common/results/breadcrumbs/Breadcrumbs.html)

## Styling your specifications

Concordion comes with a default style out of the box that is automatically applied to output specifications.

{% if html %}
Should you wish to apply this styling while you are documenting your specification, you will need to add the following to the `<head>` section of your HTML file:

    <link href="../concordion.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />

where `../` is replaced by the relative location of your concordion.css file (`..` represents the parent folder of the folder containing the specification). You may need to copy `concordion.css` from the tutorial folder, or [download concordion.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/concordion/concordion/master/src/test/resources/concordion.css).

See the [HTML example](#html-example) below for a full HTML file with a link to the concordion.css stylesheet.
{% endif %}

### Additional styling

Should you wish to enhance your specifications, you can add CSS, JavaScript, images, or other resources to tweak or completely overhaul the existing styling. If applying additional styling, {% if supports_2_0 %}the fixture will need to [specify the resources]({{site.baseurl}}/coding/{{ page.fixture_language }}/{{ page.spec_type }}#adding-resources){% else %}you'll need to [create an extension]({{site.baseurl}}/coding/{{ page.fixture_language }}/{{ page.spec_type }}#creating-an-extension) for the resources{% endif supports_2_0 %} to be copied to the output specification. {% unless supports_2_0 %}(Concordion.NET 2.0 will include a feature to simplify this.){% endunless %}

# Specification language

Concordion specifications can be written using {% if supports_2_0 %}either Markdown or {% endif %}HTML (alternatively you can use Excel with the [Excel Extension](https://github.com/concordion/concordion-excel-extension), or [write your own extension]({{site.baseurl}}/coding/{{ page.fixture_language }}/{{ page.spec_type }}#creating-an-extension) to handle other formats).{% unless supports_2_0 %} It is planned for Concordion.NET 2.0 to support Markdown format. {% endunless %} Specification suites can contain specifications written in a mixture of specification languages.

{% if md %}

## Markdown format specifications

Markdown provides an easy-to-read and easy-to-write syntax for specifications.

As a crash course, typing the following:

~~~markdown
# Heading

This is a __bold text__ in a paragraph

## Subheading

| Name            | Age |
| --------------- | --- |
| Fred Flintstone | 35  |
| Betty Rubble    | 27  |
~~~
{: #markdown-example}

results in:

![HTML output including table]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/documenting-example.png)

For further details about Markdown, read the Markdown [basics](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) and [syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

In addition to standard Markdown, Concordion supports: 

* [MultiMarkdown format tables](http://fletcher.github.io/MultiMarkdown-4/tables.html). If using Github, you might want to limit yourself to [Github Flavored Markdown tables](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#tables).
* strikethrough format using `~~tildes around the words~~`.

### Inline HTML

For syntax that is not covered by Markdown, you can use __inline HTML__. The HTML will normally need to be wrapped in a `<div>` element. For an example, see how inline HTML is used for [unusual sentence structures]({{site.baseurl}}/instrumenting/{{ page.fixture_language }}/{{ page.spec_type }}#embedded-html). 

### Extending the Markdown syntax

Markdown extensions allow you to change and/or extend the behaviour of the Markdown parser, for example to change the behaviour of new lines, or to support definition lists.

Concordion provides two ways to configure Markdown extensions:

* From Concordion 2.0.0, you can use a fixed set of [MarkdownExtensions](https://concordion.github.io/concordion/latest/javadoc/org/concordion/api/option/MarkdownExtensions.html). These are configured using the [ConcordionOptions](https://concordion.github.io/concordion/latest/spec/annotation/ConcordionOptions.html) annotation.
* From Concordion 3.0.0, you can use a wider range of extensions and configuration options provided by the Flexmark parser. Each [Flexmark extension](https://github.com/vsch/flexmark-java/wiki/Extensions#user-content-available-extensions) is packaged as its own artifact and will need to be added to your project. To add the Flexmark extension to your Concordion fixture, see [FlexmarkOptions](https://concordion.github.io/concordion/latest/spec/annotation/FlexmarkOptions.html).

### Markdown editors

While you can edit Markdown in a text editor, you'll get additional features such as preview, syntax highlighting and auto indent with a Markdown editor. There are lots of options available, including online editors, plugins to text editors such as Notepad++ and dedicated Markdown editors. You might want to make sure your editor supports tables, strikethrough and any of the other Markdown extensions you configure (see above).

#### Github 
The syntax used for this extension is compatible with Github Flavored Markdown, allowing specifications to be edited and previewed in the Github editor.

#### IDEA
The official IntelliJ IDEA [Markdown Support](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7793?pr=idea) plugin is recommended, along with the excellent [Concordion Support](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7978?pr=idea) plugin, which makes it easy to author and run Concordion specifications.

 The [Markdown Navigator](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7896?pr=idea) plugin is also supported.

Previously, we recommended the [Markdown](https://github.com/nicoulaj/idea-markdown) plugin, but this plugin is no longer maintained and has been removed from the Jetbrains plugin repository.

#### Eclipse
Available Eclipse plugins include:

| Plugin | Has editor? | Has viewer? | Viewer supports tables and strikethrough |
|--------|:-----------:|:-----------:|:----------------------------------------:|
|Mylyn Wikitext Editor| Y | Y | N |
|[Markdown Text Editor](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/markdown-text-editor)| Y | N | N |
|[Github Flavored Markdown Viewer](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/github-flavored-markdown-viewer-plugin)| N | Y | Y |
 {: .striped}

In order to have editing features and the ability to view with tables and strikethrough, we suggest installing either of the first 2 editor plugins listed above for editing, along with the Github Flavored Markdown Viewer plugin for viewing.

{% if html %}

## HTML format specifications

{% if supports_2_0 %}
Prior to Concordion 2.0, HTML was the only specification format available in Concordion core. It remains the canonical format.
{% endif %}

{% if supports_2_0 %}
While typically only a very small subset of HTML is needed (eg. &lt;p&gt;, &lt;table&gt;, &lt;b&gt;), HTML syntax provides more advanced formatting than Markdown should you need it.
{% else %}
Typically only a very small subset of HTML is needed (eg. &lt;p&gt;, &lt;table&gt;, &lt;b&gt;).
{% endif supports_2_0 %}

Concordion requires that the HTML be well-structured XHTML, ie. each start tag must have a corresponding end tag.

### Crash Course in HTML

HTML documents are written in text with special start and end tags around items. For example:

    <p>This is a paragraph</p>

The tag &lt;p&gt; signals the start of the paragraph and &lt;/p&gt; signals the end.

You can nest tags. For example:

    <p>This is <b>bold text</b> in a paragraph</p>

The syntax for a table is more complicated, but once you understand this, you'll have everything you need to write tests in Concordion.

A table uses the following tags: &lt;table&gt;, &lt;tr&gt; (table row) , &lt;th&gt; (table heading), &lt;td&gt; (table data). The table is expressed row by row. The first row contains the headings, the following rows are data. For example:

~~~html
<html>
    <head>
        <link href="../concordion.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
        <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Heading</h1>

        <p>This is a <b>bold text</b> in a paragraph</p>

        <h2>Subheading</h2>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Name</th>
                <th>Age</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Fred Flintstone</td>
                <td>35</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Betty Rubble</td>
                <td>27</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </body>
</html>
~~~
{: #html-example}

results in:

![HTML output including table]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/documenting-example.png)

Note that we include the following line in the header to support the full Unicode character set:

~~~html
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />
~~~

### HTML editors

While you can edit HTML in a text editor, you'll get additional features such as preview, syntax highlighting and auto indent with a HTML editor. There are lots of options available, including online editors, plugins to text editors such as Notepad++ and dedicated HTML editors.
