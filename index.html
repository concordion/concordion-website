                <p>Concordion lets you test-drive your code at the feature level. Concordion specifications include examples that act as a target for development. Once automated, the examples become checks that your new feature is meeting key requirements.</p>
                <p>The checks run as JUnit (Java) or NUnit (.NET) tests, so can easily be run using your current development, build and continuous integration tools. The specifications can be version controlled alongside your application code and follow the same branching and merging strategy.</p>
                <p>As part of a balanced approach, including unit tests and other checks, Concordion helps you build quality into your application and get it right first time.</p>

                <p>You'll be involved earlier in development, helping guide the examples that will checked during development. You might also document the specifications with examples or automate the checking of examples.</p>
                <p>You'll get an early warning of regressions prior to exploratory testing of the change by running the automated checks of Concordion examples on every system change.</p>
                <p>With Concordion output being written in plain language and easy to read, everyone on the team can understand what the automated checks are doing. The output can unobtrusively include screenshots, logging output and other information to help diagnose failures.</p>
                <p>The automated checking of key examples frees up your time to focus on exploratory and other testing.</p>

                <p>The collaborative specification of key examples prior to development unifies the team's understanding of required functionality, and aids discovery of uncertainty.</p>
                <p>You'll be creating just-enough documentation that is developed in conjunction with your working software. Unlike other tools, Concordion provides complete flexibility over how you write and format your specification and examples, allowing you to richly describe the system.</p>
                <p>Once the Concordion examples are automated, the resultant specification embeds the results of checking the examples, By running the automation frequently, the specifications become "living documentation" that accurately describes the current state of the system. </p>
                <p>By collaborating on the development and upkeep of specifications, your whole team become more engaged and aligned in the process.</p>

                <p>Through the up-front discussion of specifications with examples, your team will get it right first-time more often, and discover early where uncertainty exists. The alignment of development activities around examples builds trust, respect and understanding across the team.</p>
                <p>The living documentation is a valuable asset, acting as a source of truth for the current functionality of the system. You'll get the piece of mind that the system is doing what the examples show it is doing. Anybody can refer to the specifications to understand what it does, in the knowledge that the specification is up to date with any system changes.</p>
